================================REDUX COURSE=================================

Redux must be used when your application need to manage complex states to
avoinding perform troubles when using ContextAPI.

----------------------------FLOW ARCHITETURE---------------------------------

Flow architeture is the architeture Redux works on that allows us to manage
complex global states in our application.

Actions: Are actions are triggered by a function and the actions carries the
data to the reducer (the global state). An aciton must be an unique string to
be able to be indentified.

Reducer: Is the global state handler linked to a data. Its works like a lis-
tener waiting to listen to the actions and alter specific data in your global
state accoriding your action type.

To know something have been changed in our context, we need to connect our
component with the respective reducer and this specific reducer will tell our
component that something has changed in our context. We can connect several
components to our reducer.

Middlewares (Redux Saga): Does the data verification before to run some
action.

1. Install the Redux and the React Redux running yarn add react-redux redux
   @reduxjs/toolkit

2. Create a new folder named as "store" and inside this a new index.ts file,
   inside this file, import the configureStore from '@reduxjs/toolkit' and ex-
   port it.
